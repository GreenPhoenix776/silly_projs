INFO ABOUT PROGRAM:
-This version of UNO includes number cards, skip cards, draw+ cards,  and wild cards (with a +4 variant). All non-wild cards also have a color. that's kinda the point of uno.

-There is no draw+ stacking bcuz I think that's stupid and It's not a part of og uno.

-The player and AI must play a card each time it is their turn. If they do not have
a playable card in their hand, they must draw until they can play a card. 

-At current, there is no ability for the player of a wild card to choose the color that must be played next. In future updates, I may incude this.
